#Recommendation and virtual assistant for design Personalize
astronaut's schedules. Our project is the application of artificial
intelligence to assess peoples mental health on space missions.
And creating a give advice system and an activity schedule that
can help reduce the risk of mental health problems for space
mission operators.
Our system will use text from daily reports. and environment data
from sensor to input for Artificial intelligent. and output is a Mental
Health Score. After that, our system will combine the values of the
Mental Health Score with the environment data obtained from the
ICE Cubes AI Box and past activity scheduling plans to create a
recommendation system. That can recommend a personalized
schedule of activities and can help reduce the risk of mental
health problems for those working on space missions.
